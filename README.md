This is a basic Google Apps Script (Javascript) Copies events from one calendar to another through the API

In Short I wanted to teach myself a little javascript and I work best when I have a project.  
So here's the project: Create a script that can run multiple times a day that looks for events on the Group MaintEngineering calendar and add events related only to me on my own calendar.  This way it will better interact with my IOS devices, and I won't get the 20 other calendar events that week meant for other people.
